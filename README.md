Hello, I'm Jeffrey! I am a machine learning / AI researcher currently doing a PhD at Trinity College Dublin in machine learning for general and biomedical knowledge graphs. I have a M.Sc. in Data Science from Trinity College Dublin, and a B.Sc. in Bioinformatics from the University of California, San Diego. My research focuses on the concept of "Structural Alignment" -- that is, how the structure of a knowledge graph can be used to directly make inferences about it (such as link prediction), without using embeddings. I have also done work on modelling biological context in knowledge graph embeddings (the [NamE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10782639) system) and on building up a terminological database of AI / ML terms in the Irish language (the [Foclóir Tráchtais](https://focloir-riomheolaiochta.github.io/)).

While I have several ongoing projects, I'll highlight a few of the major ones here; all of them are open-sourced under research-friendly licenses!
- TWIG-I -- a structure-based, embedding-free link predictor for general knowledge graphs that allows native and effective transfer learning in the cross-KG setting. Repo: [https://github.com/Jeffrey-Sardina/TWIG-I](https://github.com/Jeffrey-Sardina/TWIG-I).
- TWIG -- a Knowledge Graph EMbedding Model (KGEM) simulator that can predict hyperparamter preference and KGEM performance from graph structure, even in the few-shot and 0-shot settings (on previously unseen knowledge graphs). Repo: [https://github.com/Jeffrey-Sardina/TWIG-TWM-dev](https://github.com/Jeffrey-Sardina/TWIG-TWM-dev).
- Query2Geom -- a modification of the Query2box box embedding system built to use geometric box intersections, rather than attention-based intersection, as a baseline for comparison. Repo: [https://github.com/Jeffrey-Sardina/Query2Geom](https://github.com/Jeffrey-Sardina/Query2Geom).
- Foclóir Tráchtas (Terms) -- an Irish-language dictionary of AI/ML terms that I created as a part of writing my thesis bilingually in English and Irish. This repo contains all terms and code to generate its website. Repo: [https://github.com/Jeffrey-Sardina/Focl-ir-Tr-chtais](https://github.com/Jeffrey-Sardina/Focl-ir-Tr-chtais).
- Foclóir Tráchtas (Site and Archive) -- this repo contains all of the code needed to test and publish the Foclóir Tráchtas website. Repo: [https://github.com/Focloir-Riomheolaiochta/Focloir-Riomheolaiochta.github.io](https://github.com/Focloir-Riomheolaiochta/Focloir-Riomheolaiochta.github.io).
